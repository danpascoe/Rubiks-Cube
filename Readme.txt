Rubik's Cube Coding Exercise
Daniel Pascoe

My submission contains both a compiled version of the application and the solution. You can find the compiled application here: /Application/RubiksCube.exe

I built the project using Visual Studio 2022 Community edition using C# .NET 7.0.

Once running, the application requires an input from the user.

F               Front face clockwise 90deg");
R               Right face clockwise 90deg");
U               Up face clockwise 90deg");
B               Back face clockwise 90deg");
L               Left face clockwise 90deg");
D               Down face clockwise 90deg");

Add an apostrophe (') after any of the above moves in order to make the rotation anti-clockwise

END             Stops the cube
HELP            Displays the help text
RESET           Resets the cube to its original state
HISTORY         Prints your previous commands
MULTI           Puts the input into "multi-mode"
		This allows you to enter multiple commands, separated by a space
